  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30/09/2025</p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 30/09/2025</p>

  <p><strong>Colo Shot</strong> ("we", "our", "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal information directly through the App.</p>
  <p>However, the App uses <strong>third-party services</strong> that may collect information automatically for the purpose of delivering ads or improving their services.</p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App integrates <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertising, including rewarded ads. Google AdMob may collect and process information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (e.g., device identifiers, advertising ID, operating system)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (if available)</li>
    <li>Interaction with ads (e.g., impressions, clicks, rewards earned)</li>
    <li>Data used for personalized advertising, if consent is granted</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more details, please review Google’s Privacy Policy:<br>
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
  </p>

  <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For personalized advertising and data collection in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, user consent is obtained through Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interest / Non-Personalized Ads:</strong> Where consent is not provided, only non-personalized ads (which rely on contextual information, not user profiles) may be shown.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our App is not directed toward children under the age of 13 (or under 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data via the App, please contact us and we will take immediate action.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights (EEA, UK, Switzerland)</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal data processed by third parties like Google</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent for personalized ads at any time via the App’s consent dialog</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We do not store any personal data. Data collected by third-party providers (such as Google) is retained according to their privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
